Story:
The app provides the user with an easy method of defining existing routes inside a building.
To solve the indoor navigation problem we are going to use markers to mark specific locations and point
of interests and edges to connect two markers and create a route ("road") between them.
The user will be able to define a road from Point A to Point B by using navigation markers and connect them using edges.

Acceptance points:
    - Sidebar menu contains all types of markers
    - Two types of markers:
        * POI (point of interest)
        * Navigation markers
    - All data is stored locally using local Storage
    - A user can drag and drop an element from the sidebar menu to the drawing board
    - Markers can be connected with each otherCannot make a direct connection between two POI
